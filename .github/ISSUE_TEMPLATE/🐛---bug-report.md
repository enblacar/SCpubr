Hello! 

Thanks for opening an Issue in SCpubr!

Here are some guidelines to correctly generate an Issue for SCpubr:

Put all relevant information asked inside of the code placeholders, 
which are denoted by these quotes:

``` 
# Some important info goes here.
```

or 

```r
# Some R code goes here.
```

The only exception is the initial salutation, which should go as normal text.
This will make the Issue look neat, structured and easy to read :P 

Finally, provide a title following the suggested scheme:

Scheme: 
BUG | function name | Description

Example: 
BUG | do_FeaturePlot | Doing this causes this problem.

Thanks a lot!
Enrique
