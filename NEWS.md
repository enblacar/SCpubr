# SCpubr 0.0.0.9000

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
- Prepare package for submission to CRAN.
- Removed `SCpubr::save_Plot()` function to align with CRAN policies that the package should not write to the file system. The code can be requested in scpubr@gmail.com, if somebody still wants it.
